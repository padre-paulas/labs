Formula One (F1) is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel, 
single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération 
Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World 
Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport 
since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the 
pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of 
rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a 
series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple 
countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.

A points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual 
World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors—now 
synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the 
highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held 
on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.

Formula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing 
cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts 
of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear 
wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, 
aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, 
automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 
1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001 but were banned once more in 
2004 and later 2008.
